# Heavy Balloons

A proof of concept game by Fabricio Zuardi. (my [Global Game Jam][ggj] 2015 [entry][ggjentry])

## About

It's a 2 player race to see who can reach the flag first, and there is only one option: to move forward!

During the course of the track, you will face harmless balloons that gets released when your character passes by them, and when they fly to your opponent's screen, they become heavy-deadly objects.

Which means that you must be careful about the balloons of your opponent as well
in order to not get hit.

Stop at the right time and run when possible, there is no turning back.

## Usage

To play, just access [http://ggj15.nulo.com.br][playurl].

## Contributing

To browse the code and launch up the local server, clone the
[git repository][gitrepo], then make sure you have [iojs][iojs] (or a recent version of [node][node] with --harmony support) and then:

**install dependencies:**

    cd ggj15
    npm install


**make the build:**

    gulp

**launch the server:**

    npm start


After that you can also use:

    gulp dev

For automatic rebundling of the js. files and automatic browser reload.

## Technology notes

I wanted to make a web-based game, and I didn't want to adopt a full-blown IDE because I like simple text editors (like [zed][zed]) and my own workflow/buld-systems. I am a Javascript-node-gulp-browserify kind of person.

So most of the time during this GGJ weekend I spent exploring different HTML5 / JS game enginesâ€¦ and they all have problems! Pretty frustrating. In the end I've settled on [Phaser.JS][phaserjs] that has many features for dealing with sprites and, more importantly, a lot of code examples on their website! :)

My technology "stack" for this project was:
